This is a project I made when I was trying to find a good price for an item on [Dmarket](https://dmarket.com), an in-game item store. Written in about an hour in python, it allows you to choose a specific type of knife to search for and finds all listings of that item in a vanilla finish.

## Running
Just run `python3 src/main.py` and select the knife you want to search for. The program will automatically find all listings for that item.
